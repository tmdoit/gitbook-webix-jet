This guide provides all the information needed to start creating web applications with Webix Jet. The book is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/webix-hub/gitbook-webix-jet) and [on GitBook](https://webix.gitbook.io/webix-jet/getting-started), so you can watch the repo to get the updates and read the tutorial online.

Webix is a library of UI components and you do not need any special techniques to create apps with it. However, while more and more components are added to a project, there is a risk to get a mess of code. This guide will provide you with an easy and convenient way of creating apps with Webix by means of using Webix Jet framework.
